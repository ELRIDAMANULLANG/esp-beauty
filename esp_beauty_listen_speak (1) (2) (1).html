    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The Beauty Department at vocational high schools (SMK) equips students with practical skills and theoretical knowledge related to hair styling, facial care, makeup application, and overall personal grooming. These competencies are essential in preparing students for careers in salons, spas, or independent beauty service businesses.</p>
    <p>In todayâ€™s globalized beauty industry, English proficiency plays an important role, especially in understanding product descriptions, following beauty tutorials, and interacting with international clients. Therefore, English for Specific Purposes (ESP) tailored to the beauty field is highly beneficial for vocational students.</p>
    <p>This ESP material focuses on developing listening and speaking skills using relevant scenarios and vocabulary specific to the beauty industry. Students will practice understanding and delivering English communication within professional beauty contexts.</p>
